There are Relationship records exits among order, delivery note and invoice rows to reserve stocks and for the consistency of reserved stocks<br/>
Calculation-processing times increase when records grow excessively in orders and reserve transactions <br/>
Closed reserve transactions can be deleted in the main table for operational speed in order, invoice, waybill and inventory receipts<br/>
Deleted records are backed up by saving them in the stock_reserve_archive table.<br/>
Relying on the size of the registration, it is recommended that this maintenance process should be done once a year or every six months<br/>
Reserve clearance processes cannot be done for invoices which dated earlier than 90 days<br/>
